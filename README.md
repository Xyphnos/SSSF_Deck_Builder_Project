# SSSF_Deck_Builder_Project

This is my MTG deck builder for a school project

### to use

1. run
```
npm install
```
2. make a .env file containing
```
DB_URL= (your mongodb url)
HTTP_PORT=3000
JWT_A_S= (your secret)
```
3. run 
```
npm start
```

## To note

to run this locally, you want to download the localBranch version, as pBranch version has different urls for jelastic.
